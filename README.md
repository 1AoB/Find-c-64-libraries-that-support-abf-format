## Find c++64 libraries that support abf format

**ABF（Axon Binary File）**

## specific content

Looking for a C++64 library that could completely replace pyabf, I tried to filter through search engines to achieve this goal:

1. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/libaxon/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libaxon/)

It claims to be a C++ library that reads and writes abf, but it still requires #include <Python.h>headers, which is disappointing.

2. [https://github.com/swharden/ABF-SDK](https://github.com/swharden/ABF-SDK)

This is a great ABF SDK, but it only supports x86, which is quite frustrating.

3. [https://github.com/1AoB/ABFview](https://github.com/1AoB/ABFview)

This is a 32-bit C # library, which is clearly not what we need.

4. [https://github.com/yamad/libabf](https://github.com/yamad/libabf)

This library has no documentation or examples, making it difficult to develop. Based on the current progress, it can read the total number of data points. As for how to read and write specific data, I don't know the API, it's difficult.
