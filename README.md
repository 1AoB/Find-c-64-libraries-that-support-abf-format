Find c++64 libraries that support abf format

Looking for a C++64 library that could completely replace pyabf, I tried to filter through search engines to achieve this goal:

1. [https://sourceforge.net/projects/libaxon/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libaxon/)
It claims to be a C++ library that reads and writes abf, but it still requires #include <Python.h>headers, which is disappointing.

2. [[11](https://github.com/swharden/ABF-SDK)](https://github.com/swharden/ABF-SDK)

This is a great ABF SDK, but it only supports x86, which is quite frustrating.
